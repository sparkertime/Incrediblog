title: ChiSC Meeting - 7/20 - "Processes & Patterns"
---

**We're in need of a venue for this meeting - if your know of a place in the Loop that could help, please [contact me](/contact)**

We're all familiar with words like "process" and "patterns" - in this meeting, we'll look at different ways to think about and apply those terms in ways you may not expect.

Groupon's **Blake Smith** will begin by examining why design patterns lead to good designs at the small-scale program level, why they often get ignored at the macro large-scale system level, and the impacts of doing so on your applications. 

Then we'll switch gears and go through a group exercise on understanding why your employer, (yes, *your* employer) has the process it does and how that impacts you. As with the previous exercises, this could be a huge success or huge failure but should be entertaining either way.

**As always, anyone of any experience level and any background is welcome to come and participate.**

Food and socialization will begin at 6PM on Wednesday, July 20th, and we'll the start the meeting a bit after that. Once we're done, we'll wander on down the street to socialize and intoxify.

If you're interested, [please RSVP here](http://chisc.gathers.us/events/chicago-software-craftsmanship-processes-patterns).

**Both portions be interactive, so please come ready to participate.**
